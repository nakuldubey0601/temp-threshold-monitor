cloud based temperature threshold monitoring system for pharmaceutical system

Cloud Based Temperature Threshold Monitoring System for Pharmaceutical Industries is a cloud based advance temperature monitoring and controlling system equipped with high tech IoT technology which give output of current temperature of industry installed HVAC, system time, generated records, strength of signal, and further humidity and temperature factors. This application uses Bolt IoT kit with added sensors and continuous Internet connection. User and administrator can remotely access the data over cloud and take preventive measures required at time which will give advancement in management system of medicine manufacturing and supply chain also. This application sends SMS, Email, and Notification to all the monitoring devices, the administration, and to whomsoever the authority has given the right to receive that. We have developed this whole application which not only measures the current temperature but also adjusts the threshold according to the industry use. Besides, whenever the temperature is about to reach its threshold value it alarmed the whole industry by siren connected to the application.The advantage of this application is it also stores the data over cloud in CSV format and then we run our prediction algorithm which shows us that on which time of the day temperature get lower down so that we can adjust the system according to that and increase the temperature of HVAC and use this feature efficiently.

You need to have Bolt IoT kit first to initialize and develop this product you can buy one from here - https://shop.boltiot.com/?hsCtaTracking=dea1326d-4eb7-4be1-b9a8-0531de55668f%7Cac3746df-809c-4a38-a551-467c392825b6
